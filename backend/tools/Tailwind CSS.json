    "introduction": "Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs without leaving your HTML. Utility-first means it offers a wide range of single-purpose classes that can be composed together to create complex designs directly in the markup.",
    "used_where": "I have not used Tailwind CSS professionally, but I use it on side projects. In fact, I used it to style this very website, including the components and layout currently being displayed."
